* `01-Search strings for grey literature.xlsx`
	* In this file, we constructed search strings in a fixed pattern, i.e. (Modeling language name) AND (tool OR editor OR notation OR modeling), for example, (UML) AND (tool OR editor OR notation OR modeling)
	* We selected the modeling languages' name from expert knowledge, browsing the web pages of well-known modeling tools from reference set (e.g. Papyrus), and using the list such as Wikipedia's page on "Modeling languages"
	* And we also did a double-check manually before constructing search terms, as there are some modeling languages are not relevant to our topic, such as X3D, and this step was also conducted by at least 2 people.
* `02-Trial search with ten hits (for excluding modeling languages).xlsx`
	* We did a trial search with all the search strings (for the languages contained in them), we would remove one search string if first page (10 hits in default) of it doesn't contain a link to a modeling tool for the language, by which way we narrowed down the list of the strings
* `03-Grey Literature Search Results.xlsx`
	* After narrowed down the list of search strings, we started our formal search one by one, and collected the first 50 hits from all the search, and plus a duplicate remove work, finally we got 1494 hits.
* `04-Grey Literature Search Results (After Reviewing).xlsx`
	* In this xlsx, we conducted a review work in which we reviewed every result by according to the criteria (which is already mentioned in paper)
	* We have a three people team for reviewing all the results and at least two reviewer for each of them
	* if two reviewers hold different opintions on the review of the same link, our whole team will review again and vote it.
